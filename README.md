# NestJS System Design

This project contains NestJS examples of different system design patterns, like communications, domain layers, patterns and etc.

> Over time, your decisions made during development become so numerous that you need to save them somewhere. Previously, I was looking for a universal solution (boilerplate) for all our projects. But with experience came the realization that every problem has its own best and worst solutions. Since I develop mainly on NestJS, the goal of this project is to show the best implementation of a particular pattern.

This projects inspired by

- [System Design Patterns](https://github.com/Sairyss/system-design-patterns)
- [Domain-Driven Hexagon](https://github.com/Sairyss/domain-driven-hexagon)
- [Backend best practices](https://github.com/Sairyss/backend-best-practices)
